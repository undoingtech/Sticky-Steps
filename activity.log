I was laying on the couch, wondering what my project would be.
I was "shuffling" some sticky notes. Just fidgeting with them.
I thought about how tasks go on sticky notes.
It would be nice if one task was on one note, so that you can focus on it.
(While on the computer at least).
But I had a whole stack of sticky notes chained together, so I thought
about chaining tasks together.
The idea is to have a "stack" of notes that have one task each. 
This is suitable for ordered tasks and for instructions.

I wanted this project to be cross platform, so I looked up
cross platform libraries.
I read: 
- [gui library for beginner C++ programmer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5248105/gui-library-for-beginner-c-programmer)
- [What's the most enjoyable cross-platform GUI toolkit?](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-most-enjoyable-cross-platform-GUI-toolkit?share=1)
- [PyQt vs Tkinter â€“ The better GUI library](https://coderslegacy.com/pyqt-vs-tkinter/)

I wanted to use C or python since I already have some experience using those languages. It was convenient also since there are several cross platform GUI toolkits for C and python.
I wanted a well documented toolkit. 

I picked Tk because I want to create a minimal application.
I do not need a whole bunch of widgets or other functionality.
The PyQt vs Tkinter article also mentioned and showed that elements in tkinter are more "fuzzy" than those in PyQt. This is good for my project since I want most focus on the text and less focus on the buttons. (at least I hope. I do want the app to look good).

Got tkinter working to open a window in the top right corner.

Created small test document.

Got extensions `markdown` and `tkhtmlview`.
Got them working on the test document.
1. Read test.md
2. Converted md to html
3. Displayed html
The headers are super big. I am not sure I like it, but it is working.
There is also an invisible scroll.
The size of the text is the only contention I have. It seems too big.
There might not be enough space for instructions.
I will continue to use it anyway tho. It may grow on me.

Made a step list by splitting html on horizontal rules.

Made a button to change the step.
Now I need to restructure the code so that it doesn't become a giant mess.
Planning time, sorta.
