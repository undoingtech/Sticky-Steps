StickySteps has many keybindings. Press **h** to see them all.

#### Scrolling

Use your mouse wheel to scroll if some text is overflowing past the bottom of the window.

If there is a lot of text, the overflow will be hidden. Vertical scrolling is enabled, but you will not see a scrollbar. You must use the mouse wheel.

#### Markdown Elements

The rest of the steps are for showing how Markdown elements look in StickySteps. Not all elements work in correct or predictable ways.

All elements used are from the Basic Syntax list on the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) The only element you will not see is the horizontal rule.

Code does not render correctly. Code is supposed to be inline like **bold** and *italicized*, but instead `CODE` gets its own line.
